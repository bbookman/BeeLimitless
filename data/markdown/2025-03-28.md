### I was working with Sarah and an assistant, trying to load large format paper (20x30) into a printer.  Loading the "cut sheet" was tricky and required precise alignment.  The printer wouldn't proceed until the paper was correctly loaded, which was frustrating.  We eventually got it loaded and then moved on to printing 5x7 cards.  There was a brief issue where it seemed like something didn't print, but it was the same process as the cut sheets.

#### Atmosphere
The atmosphere was a bit stressful due to the finicky nature of the printer.  There was some lighthearted frustration expressed, but overall, we were working together to solve the problem.  It seems like this is a recurring issue with this particular printer.

#### Key Takeaways
* Loading cut sheets into the large format printer is a difficult and precise process.
* The printer will not continue until the cut sheet is aligned correctly.
* We successfully loaded the cut sheet and printed 5x7 cards.
* There was a minor printing issue that was resolved.
* Sarah might know a trick to loading the cut sheets, and I should ask Kathy about her trick as well.

### I learned how to load paper into a large format printer with the help of Sherry, Sarah, and a few other colleagues.  We had some initial trouble figuring out the correct paper size and getting the roll to feed properly.  The printer kept saying it was ready to print, even though there was no paper loaded. We eventually got it working, but there were a few hiccups along the way. We also discussed a "glacier poster" that needed printing.  Later, I shared a tip about recording register counts one at a time to avoid errors, based on my own anxiety about losing track of money. I also asked if we sold Bliss decks and was directed to the area near Burt's Bees.

#### Atmosphere
The atmosphere was collaborative and supportive, with everyone working together to troubleshoot the printer issues.  There was a sense of learning and experimentation as we figured things out. My anxiety was acknowledged and validated.

#### Key Takeaways
* Learned how to load and operate the large format printer.
* Successfully printed the "glacier poster."
* Shared a tip about recording register counts individually to minimize errors.
* Learned where the Bliss decks are sold (near Burt's Bees).

### I spent some time today reminiscing about my childhood friends, Keith Leaper, Dave Peters, and Sean Dinsmore.  Keith was a goofy guy from grade school and middle school who later became a police officer.  We went to Prospect High School together, and he even dated Alicia before I did! Dave Peters, another friend from grade school and high school, was into magic. I reconnected with him briefly years later when I was in Los Angeles for a Snapchat developer conference.  Sean Dinsmore lived close by on Twila Lane, and we spent a lot of time together, especially playing Hako (a bike/golf club/ball game we invented) and Workups (a type of baseball using our garage door and driveway). His dad, Bruce Dinsmore, was our Cub Scout and Boy Scout leader. I also remembered walking to Keith and Dave's houses, which were a couple of miles away, and stopping at the Stop and Go convenience store. It was a popular hangout for us, with candy, soda, and unfortunately, also porn magazines. I even confessed to stealing candy and Star Wars cards from there by cutting a hole in my puffy winter jacket.  I texted Matt Bookman to see if he still had his Star Wars cards.  I also recalled getting caught stealing CDs from a Kmart or Walmart, having to call my dad, and getting in big trouble.

#### Atmosphere
Nostalgic and reflective. I was clearly enjoying the trip down memory lane, even the embarrassing parts about stealing.

#### Key Takeaways
* Remembered childhood friends Keith Leaper, Dave Peters, and Sean Dinsmore, and their various quirks and activities we shared.
* Recalled walking long distances as a kid, unlike kids today.
* Described creating a Halloween-themed app using Swift and trying to integrate it with Snapchat, which led to an invitation to a Snapchat developer conference.
* Confessed to youthful indiscretions of stealing from Stop and Go.
* Texted Matt Bookman about Star Wars cards.
* Wondered if my parents and brother had contributed to my journaling project.

### I needed to see a doctor urgently for a possible ear infection following a persistent head cold.  I decided to try a telehealth appointment using Teledoc. After a bit of a struggle navigating their website and phone system, I successfully registered and provided my insurance information.  Dr. Randy Silverstein diagnosed the ear infection and prescribed an antibiotic to be taken twice daily for seven days. He advised me to seek further in-person examination if my condition doesn't improve by next week and sent the prescription to CVS on Carolina Beach Rd.  After the appointment, I set a 20-minute timer, presumably related to picking up the prescription, and tended to my dog, Grape, who had just gone "poopies."  There was also some frustration expressed regarding an unrelated technical issue with "key takeaways" and "clean summary," possibly related to a computer program or note-taking app.

#### Atmosphere
The overall atmosphere was one of mild stress and urgency due to the medical need, punctuated by moments of frustration with technology and tender interactions with pets.  The successful telehealth consultation brought a sense of relief.

#### Key Takeaways
* Diagnosed with an ear infection.
* Prescribed antibiotics, twice daily for 7 days.
* Prescription sent to CVS on Carolina Beach Rd.
* Follow-up in-person appointment needed if no improvement by early next week.
