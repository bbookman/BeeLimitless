### You had a busy morning. You were cleaning and seemed a little frustrated with someone who kept pointing out things you may have missed. You talked about a diaper incident with Ivette and seemed to think the diaper may have had a hole. Later, you talked about potentially having the garage and asked someone what they were up to today. It seemed like they might have been talking about the stock market.
