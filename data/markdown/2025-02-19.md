### Just had a quick catch-up with Yvette. We talked about the school delay for Thursday - looks like it's a go, according to the text message I received.  She told me about a strange encounter with a guy at the airport in Guadalajara. He kept following her and asking for her number, even after she made it clear she wasn't interested. Thankfully, she's safe and sound now. We also had a sweet moment with Grape, who climbed all the way up the stairs to see me. Yvette even got to say a quick hello. 

##

#### Atmosphere
The conversation was a mix of lighthearted and concerning. We joked about the reboot and the school delay, but the tone shifted when Yvette shared her experience with the persistent man at the airport.  Despite the unsettling story, we ended on a positive note,  enjoying Grape's antics and her eagerness to see me.

##

#### Key Takeaways
* There will be a 2-hour school delay on Thursday, February 25th.
* Yvette had an unnerving experience with a man who wouldn't leave her alone at the airport. 
* Grape is doing well and is becoming quite the little climber!
