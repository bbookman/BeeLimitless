### This morning started with a bit of a scare. Jonathan must have bumped his nose in the bathroom, leaving scattered tissues all over the floor. Thankfully, he seems to be okay. Later, I had another frustrating call with Coastal Carolina Neuropsychiatric Center. I've called multiple times requesting a signed document from my psychiatrist, Dr. Dorinda Due, outlining my diagnosis and F codes. Despite my repeated calls, I haven't received a response or any indication of when this document will be ready. 

##

#### Atmosphere
The interaction starts with a frantic tone as I try to assess Jonathan's well-being after he hurts himself. The mood shifts to frustration and exasperation during my call with the Neuropsychiatric Center. Their lack of communication and follow-through is unacceptable.

##

#### Key Takeaways
* Jonathan bumped his nose but appears to be fine.
* I still haven't received the signed document from Dr. Due.
* The lack of response from Coastal Carolina Neuropsychiatric Center is concerning and unprofessional. 
* I will continue to follow up until I receive the document.
