###Summary
I needed to see a doctor urgently for a possible ear infection following a persistent head cold.  I decided to try a telehealth appointment using Teledoc. After a bit of a struggle navigating their website and phone system, I successfully registered and provided my insurance information.  Dr. Randy Silverstein diagnosed the ear infection and prescribed an antibiotic to be taken twice daily for seven days. He advised me to seek further in-person examination if my condition doesn't improve by next week and sent the prescription to CVS on Carolina Beach Rd.  After the appointment, I set a 20-minute timer, presumably related to picking up the prescription, and tended to my dog, Grape, who had just gone "poopies."  There was also some frustration expressed regarding an unrelated technical issue with "key takeaways" and "clean summary," possibly related to a computer program or note-taking app.

#### Atmosphere
The overall atmosphere was one of mild stress and urgency due to the medical need, punctuated by moments of frustration with technology and tender interactions with pets.  The successful telehealth consultation brought a sense of relief.

#### Key Takeaways
* Diagnosed with an ear infection.
* Prescribed antibiotics, twice daily for 7 days.
* Prescription sent to CVS on Carolina Beach Rd.
* Follow-up in-person appointment needed if no improvement by early next week.

###Summary
I started working on my life journal project today. I asked my family for their help, specifically requesting more details about Mom's work life. I have a distinct memory of her asking Matt and me about her potentially stopping work to spend more time at home, but I can't recall our ages or the specific context. I'd love to hear everyone's perspective on this memory, including their thoughts and feelings at the time.  I let everyone know they could respond in any format they prefer and that it's okay if they choose not to respond.  I set a 40-minute timer to focus on this. Later, I took the dogs, Peach and Grape, out to the bathroom several times.  Peach had diarrhea, which was concerning, especially since I had to leave for work soon after. I felt sick to my stomach myself.

#### Atmosphere
The atmosphere was a mix of focused reflection and the usual daily chaos of dog care and getting ready for work.  There was a sense of nostalgia and curiosity surrounding the life journal project, contrasted with the urgency and slight stress of dealing with Peach's upset stomach and my own illness.

#### Key Takeaways
* Started life journal project and requested family input on a specific memory about Mom's work life.
* Peach had diarrhea and I felt sick to my stomach before work.
* Set a 40-minute timer to work on the project.

He recounted some history, remembering his parents meeting in college, both being born in Florida, and sharing the middle name "Jean" with slightly different spellings. Lois was a working woman for much of Bruce's life, instilling in him the value of female independence and a liberal worldview. Bruce is puzzled by his parents' relationship, recalling his father causing his mother pain and them attending marriage counseling. Lois later suffered from depression, which was diagnosed late in life. Bruce shared a poignant memory of slapping his mother in the face, possibly during a manic episode related to his bipolar disorder. He also recalled Lois's dislike for a job she held at what he believes was the Radiologic Science Institute (RSI), possibly involving cancer research and experiments on mice. Bruce fondly remembered childhood antics with his younger brother, Matt, involving stuffed animals, a greenhouse, and a sandbox where cats sometimes left "gifts." He recalled making Matt drink a concoction to get out of the greenhouse. Bruce also discussed his retirement investments with someone, emphasizing the importance of adjusting investment strategies based on age and target retirement date.

Reflective and introspective, with a touch of sadness and regret. Bruce's tone is conversational and candid, as if confiding in a close friend.
