### Today was a busy day filled with little moments. I had a funny interaction with someone who was wearing a pro-LGBTQ+ shirt.  Given we are in North Carolina, I told her how brave she was for wearing it, assuming she was local. Turns out, she was from California! We had a nice chat about how her home state is much more liberal.  She even told me, "You should see my car," which made me laugh.  I also had to help Ivette find a form for Russell - it was on her desk. It was a  "YWCA Employee Handbook" acknowledgment form for Russell to sign.  Later on, I took a moment to appreciate the nice weather in Wilmington - sunny with a high of 64Â° -  with my dogs, Grape and Peach.  They are such good dogs! I'm a little worried about my health, though. I need to remember to talk to my doctor on Monday about my lab results, my high blood glucose levels even with the Farxiga, and the fact that my elbow injection didn't help.
