### I started working on my life journal project today. I asked my family for their help, specifically requesting more details about Mom's work life. I have a distinct memory of her asking Matt and me about her potentially stopping work to spend more time at home, but I can't recall our ages or the specific context. I'd love to hear everyone's perspective on this memory, including their thoughts and feelings at the time.  I let everyone know they could respond in any format they prefer and that it's okay if they choose not to respond.  I set a 40-minute timer to focus on this. Later, I took the dogs, Peach and Grape, out to the bathroom several times.  Peach had diarrhea, which was concerning, especially since I had to leave for work soon after. I felt sick to my stomach myself.

#### Atmosphere
The atmosphere was a mix of focused reflection and the usual daily chaos of dog care and getting ready for work.  There was a sense of nostalgia and curiosity surrounding the life journal project, contrasted with the urgency and slight stress of dealing with Peach's upset stomach and my own illness.

#### Key Takeaways
* Started life journal project and requested family input on a specific memory about Mom's work life.
* Peach had diarrhea and I felt sick to my stomach before work.
* Set a 40-minute timer to work on the project.

### Bruce had a moment of reflection, journaling about his mother, Lois Bookman, and his relationship with her. He feels a sense of distance despite loving her deeply and acknowledging her constant care and support throughout his life.  He recounted some history, remembering his parents meeting in college, both being born in Florida, and sharing the middle name "Jean" with slightly different spellings. Lois was a working woman for much of Bruce's life, instilling in him the value of female independence and a liberal worldview.

He also recalled Lois's dislike for a job she held at what he believes was the Radiologic Science Institute (RSI), possibly involving cancer research and experiments on mice.

### I spent some time today reflecting on my friendship with Matt Aquino. We met in high school and became good friends along with Alan Clark and Mike Rabel. Matt introduced me to alternative music and we shared a lot of laughs, inside jokes, and trips to Disneyland.  We even made a silly "Real World" parody video together. After high school, Matt went to UC Berkeley to study filmmaking, while Mike went to UC Santa Cruz for the same. Matt struggled to find work initially, but eventually landed a job at a small media company called Frame by Frame, run by our acquaintance Sean Frame.  Randy Hawkins, another friend, also worked there later. I even had a small part in a commercial they filmed!  Matt eventually met his wife, Julie, and they adopted a sweet little girl. Over time, due to distance and family life, we drifted apart. I haven't spoken to him in a while, but I'm thinking of giving him a call to reconnect. I also thought about Alan Clark, who I was once very close with, but we've grown distant.  I'm less fond of Mike these days.  I also tried calling Suzanne Sparacio and Randy Hawkins, but couldn't reach them.  There was also a discussion with my family about Russell's car accident and the confusing details surrounding the traffic lights at the intersection where it occurred.  It seems there's a dispute about who was at fault.

#### Atmosphere
Nostalgic and reflective while recounting memories of friendships.  Frustrated and concerned when discussing the car accident.

#### Key Takeaways
* Strong desire to reconnect with Matt Aquino.
* Fond memories of high school and early adulthood with Matt, Alan, and Mike.
* Sadness about drifted friendships.
* Confusion and frustration regarding Russell's car accident and the insurance company's response.
* Need to follow up on the accident and potentially seek a different insurance representative.
