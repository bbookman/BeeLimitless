### This morning started with a difficult conversation with Ivette about our son, Benetton. We're struggling to find solutions for his recent challenges, which include a possible drug problem and an incident at school where he was physically hurt.  We're trying to support him with love and guidance, but Ivette is understandably stressed and feels like we need to do more.  We're looking into additional resources, like therapy and exploring online information about teenagers and drug use. I'm also planning to spend some quality time with Benetton, reminiscing about happy memories to remind him that he's loved and has a good life.

Tense and emotional.  Ivette is clearly at her wit's end and frustrated with the situation.  There's a sense of urgency in her voice as she pushes for solutions. I'm trying to remain calm and supportive, but I also feel the weight of the situation.

* **Seek professional help:**  We need to find a therapist for Benetton, even though his doctor recommended waiting.
