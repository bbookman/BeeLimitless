### I was looking at something with Ivette and made a comment about its size. Ivette pointed out something I had said previously, seemingly in relation to the size of the object.  There was a brief pause where I asked for a minute. Another person, possibly nearby, made a comment about the frequency of such occurrences. They also asked me for confirmation about something, to which I replied "yes".

#### Atmosphere
The atmosphere seems light and possibly playful, perhaps involving a gentle teasing about my previous statement. The interaction feels casual and familiar.

#### Key Takeaways
* Ivette highlighted a previous comment I made, likely related to the size of an object we were both looking at.

### I had a therapy session today focusing on managing my rage.  We discussed several incidents over the past three weeks where I experienced intense anger, including one where I threw a fork at the kitchen door during an argument with Yvette about parenting Russell.  My therapist suggested that my rage stems from a childhood fear of instability and unreliability, likely rooted in my parents' frequent fighting and my father's unpredictable behavior.  He guided me through a visualization exercise where I hugged my rage, reimagining it as my younger self or even my father as a baby, needing comfort and reassurance.  This helped me shift my perspective from "love me, punish me" to a sense of being in control of my emotions.  He also recommended the "Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook."  We rescheduled our next appointment for Monday, April 7th at 3:00 PM.  After the session, there was a brief, confusing exchange with someone about a dog bed.

#### Atmosphere
The session was emotionally charged as I explored the roots of my anger and experimented with new coping mechanisms.  Initially, there was some frustration around the topic of time management, but the focus shifted to addressing my rage. The visualization exercise was particularly impactful, leading to a sense of relaxation and control. The conversation after the session was more chaotic and unclear.

#### Key Takeaways
* My rage is connected to childhood experiences of instability and a lack of reliability.
* Visualizing and "hugging" my rage can help me manage it by fostering a sense of control and self-soothing.
* I need to practice this visualization technique regularly, even when I'm only slightly angry.
* I should get a copy of the "Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook."
* My next therapy appointment is scheduled for Monday, April 7th at 3:00 PM.
